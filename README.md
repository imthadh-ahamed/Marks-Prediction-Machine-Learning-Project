<h1 align="center">Final Marks Prediction</h1>

I've delved into predictive analytics by developing a web application using Python and Flask. This platform harnesses the power of machine learning to predict final marks based on mid-semester grades and attendance records. <br><br>

Key Contributions:
<ul>
  <li>Predictive Model Development: Created a Linear Regression model to predict students' final marks using mid-semester grades and attendance data.</li>
  <li>Data Handling and Preparation: Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing, ensuring dataset cleanliness and suitability for training.</li>
  <li>Web Application Development: Leveraged Flask to construct an intuitive web interface for users to input data and receive predictions.</li>
  <li>Frontend Implementation: Designed a user-friendly frontend using HTML and CSS to enhance accessibility.</li>
  <li>Model Evaluation: Split the dataset into 75% training and 25% testing data, resulting in robust prediction accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Tools and Technologies:
<ul>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook: Initial exploration and model development.</li>
  <li>VSCode: Primary development environment for its efficiency.</li>
  <li>Pandas: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.</li>
  <li>Scikit-learn: Employed for training the Linear Regression model.</li>
  <li>Flask: Deployment of the machine learning model as a web application.</li>
  <li>HTML & CSS: Designed frontend for a responsive user interface.</li>
</ul>

Project Outcomes:
<ul>
  <li>Empowered Students: Enables students to accurately assess academic performance and identify areas for improvement.</li>
  <li>Educator Support: Assists educators in identifying students who may require additional support, enhancing educational outcomes.</li>
  <li>Seamless User Experience: Provides a straightforward interface for users to input data and receive predictions.</li>
</ul>
